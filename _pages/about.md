I'm an Associate Professor from [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/AboutUs/preview.html?uid=012128), [School of Management at Fudan University]( https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn). 
I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xinsheng Zhang at Fudan University.  I got my Ph.D. degree in Mathematical Statistics from School of Management at Fudan University in 2019. During 2019-2020 I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in [Department of Statistics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk) with Prof. Qiman Shao.
My research interest includes high dimensional data analysis, change point analysis, robust statistical inference and machine learning.

Talks
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
